builder = VI that can be called from command line

builder will make an exe for launcher.vi

circle ci config file that uses builder. job runs every time we merge into cooking-master

launcher.vi calls a new subVI, http request with circle ci api token to check for new exe
    if new exe
        download new exe
        replace old exe with new exe
        increment build number to check for next time
        close out
        user will manually start new exe?
    else start normally

need to make a Windows docker image that has labview installed
circle ci config will use above image, get new repo with launcher, gea comm project, and daq project, and builder
call builder with run, command in config file
upload output as artifact
